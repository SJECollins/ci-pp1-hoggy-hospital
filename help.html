                <p>
                    Interested in helping the Hoggy Hospital's patients? Thank you! We are always in need of any help that members of the public are willing to give. Whether it's donating to the hospital, sponsoring one of our longterm residents, or volunteering your time and energy to one of our fundraising campaigns, we are grateful!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a small wildlife charity, our resources are stretched thin and every donation goes directly to the animals in our care. We could not continue our work without your help.

                <p>
                    We don't just accept financial donations, though they're very much appreciated! Newspapers, puppy-pads, towels - let us know what you have to spare and we'll let you know if we can use it.

                    Unfortunately, not all of our patients can be safely released after treatment. Contact us to sponsor one of our longterm residents and we'll keep you up to date on how they're doing.
