## Features
### Navigation
- The header element features a navbar that is used across all pages. It remains at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the pages so they can easily navigate to different pages without having to return to the top of the page.
- To the right of the navbar are links to the three main pages of the website. On hover, the links transition to green to ackowledge the users interaction. The "active" page has a bottom-border in green to reflect which page the user is on.
- The navbar features a logo to the left side which navigates to the main page. On larger screens the logo features a hedgehog with text of the name of the organisation. On smaller devices, the logo is replaced with a simple hedgehog to maintain branding but provide space for the links. On very small screens, the logo is removed to allow the links to be easily accessed and prevent misclicking on small devices.
- The background colour is a black and the text is in white to provide good contrast. The transition and bottom-border are in green as it contrasts well with the black.

### Footer
- The footer element features social media links for the organisation. It features across all pages.
- The links feature a similar transition to green as the navbar.

### Index Page

The first page comprises four sections that introduce the user to the organisation, provide information about work of the organisation, and features a video accompanied by a call to action and an invitation to explore the website further.

#### Hero Image - Index.html
- The hero section contains a large hero image of a hedgehog overlaid by the title of the website and organisation.
- The title features an ease-in transition when the page loads to draw the users eye.
- The section contains a call-to-action contact button below the title. Although the contact page is easily visible on the navigation bar, the button being immediately displayed in the header means the user can find contact information quickly.

#### About Section
- The about section features three short paragraphs of text giving the user an introduction to the organisation. These paragraphs are intentionally short so as to encourage the user to keep reading. 
- The section is styled such that on large screens the paragraphs display as a row, but wrap to fit beneath each other on smaller devices.
- The text contains inline links to the How To Help page and Contact Us page, where appropriate. These are styled in the same colour as the CTA button in the Hero section.

### Why Help Hedgehogs Section
- This section provides information to the user about the reasons animals come into the care of the organisation. This serves to provide motivation for the user to become emotionally invested in the work the organisation undertakes.
- The section is styled with a background image which appears as the user scrolls down so that as the text information comes into focus, so too does the hedgehog's face. This also is aimed at appealling to the user to become emotionally invested while rewarding them with a cute image as they scroll down the page.
