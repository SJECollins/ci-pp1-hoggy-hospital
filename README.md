## Features
### Navigation
- The header element features a navbar that is used across all pages. It remains at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the pages so they can easily navigate to different pages without having to return to the top of the page.
- To the right of the navbar are links to the three main pages of the website. On hover, the links transition to green to ackowledge the users interaction. The "active" page has a bottom-border in green to reflect which page the user is on.
- The navbar features a logo to the left side which navigates to the main page. On larger screens the logo features a hedgehog with text of the name of the organisation. On smaller devices, the logo is replaced with a simple hedgehog to maintain branding but provide space for the links. On very small screens, the logo is removed to allow the links to be easily accessed and prevent misclicking on small devices.
- The background colour is a black and the text is in white to provide good contrast. The transition and bottom-border are in green as it contrasts well with the black.
