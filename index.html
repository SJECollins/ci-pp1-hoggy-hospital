                <p>
                    Welcome to the <strong>Hoggy Hospital</strong>! From humble beginnings working out of a garden shed on evenings and weekends, the Hoggy Hospital has grown into a fully fledged wildlife charity with our very own dedicated facilities in the heart of county Kildare. We are a passionate group of hedgehog helpers from all walks of life brought together by our love of Ireland's native wildlife.

                    Our facilities are well located just on the outskirts of <a href="contact.html" aria-label="Navigates to contact page">Naas</a> in Co. Kildare, where we have established a dedicated hospital with everything needed to treat, rehabilitate and eventually release our prickly patients back into their lives in the wild. With the support of visiting veterinary staff who volunteer their time with us, we offer the best care available to every animal that visits our hospital.

                    As a wildlife charity, we rely on <a href="help.html" aria-label="Navigates to How To Help page">support</a> from the public to provide for the hedgehogs under our care. These animals are vulnerable to a variety of illnesses and are often impacted by humans, whether directly - for example, on the road - or indirectly - through the effects of climate change. We believe they deserve our help. Please read on to learn more about what we do.

        <h2>Why Hedgehogs Need Your Help</h2>
        <div class="reasons">
            <div class="reasons-bg">
                <p>
                    Hedgehogs come to us for a number of reasons. Year round, we receive calls from members of the public finding hedgehogs who have been  been victims on Irish roads or found seriously ill due to disease or parasite infestation.  Of course, our busiest time of the year is autumn when hedgehogs are supposed to be going into hibernation. We take in a lot of ill, underweight hedgehogs between September and October who aren't healthy enough to hibernate and, unfortunately, would not be able to survive the winter without our help. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="reasons-bg">
                <p>
                    Sadly, even hibernating hedgehogs aren't safe and we often get calls from people whose own pets have discovered a hedgehog nest in their garden and have injured them. In the garden, hedgehogs are also vulnerable to strimmers, lawnmowers and even well-meaning people who feed them diets that can lead to metabolic diseases. <br>
                    We take in hundreds of prickly patients every year and the number has only increased since we first started.
